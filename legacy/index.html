			(this website is in HTML only. If you are asking why, i don't know, but atleast you can use your "UdiWWW" browser from 1995 and it would work (not sure for older
			browsers though and i don't know which HTML version this website uses but maybe it's up to the browser to decide). Also Forced dark mode works flawless here, so feel
			free to use it!)

		<p>(Extra note for PLDT users: i made this for you sufferers of the earth, here's a tip: please SWAP TO A DIFFERENT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!)</p>

		<p>
			Extra note: The websites linked here are NOT in <i>vanilla</i> HTML, and I don't own any of them. Older browsers will <b>NOT</b> work for these sites. Sorry! (also I
			know you are screaming but I made this site to include some extra content in the near future)
