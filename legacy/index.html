        <p>"4K Video Downloader" is not listed here due to this software breaking YouTube's TOS.
            (I think) I can mention it in this website, but i won't let you get the app from here. i'm trying to play it safe.</p>

            (this website is in HTML only. If you are asking why, i don't know, but atleast you can use your "UdiWWW" browser from 1995 and it would work (not sure for older browsers though and i don't know which HTML version this website uses but maybe it's up to the browser to decide). Also Forced dark mode works flawless here, so feel free to use it!)</p>

            <p>(Extra note for PLDT users: i made this for you sufferers of the earth, here's a tip: please SWAP TO A DIFFERENT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!)</p>

            <p>Extra note: The webistes linked here are NOT in HTML, and i don't own any of them. older browsers will NOT work for these sites. Sorry! (also i know you are screaming but i made this site to include some extra content in the near future)</p>
